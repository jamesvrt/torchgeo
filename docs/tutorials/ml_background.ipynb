In general, remote sensing datasets often contain much higher dimensional images than datasets the reader might be used to. Additionall, Deep Learning models often require a given image input dimension and therefore, a main objective of this tutorial will be to demonstrate how to do this for all types of TorchGeo Datasets.\n",

    "Geospatial Datasets, implemented as GeoDataset class in TorchGeo, contain geospatial information such as latitude, longitude, coordinate stystem, and projection. Furthermore, Geospatial Datasets can contain Raster or Vector Data (Explain difference here). When working with remote sensory data such as satellite imagery, there occurs a projection that transforms the surface of the 3D Globe onto a 2D image that we are used to seeing. Additionally, the data should include the precise geographical location of a captured image. For this purpose cartographers have developed a framework called the coordinate reference system (CRS), which aims to display the spherical earh in just two dimensions. Due to this, all projections will yield some distortion of distance, area, or angular properties! A nice example of, how different CRS distort a given map, can be found here. There exist many different CRS (link here) that each have their advantages and disadvantages depending on the location, scale, and purpose of a map. As a consequence, TorchGeo's Geospatial datasets have a crs parameter, that lets you project the given dataset as you deem useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another substantial difference between TorchGeo's Geospatial Datasets and common Pytorch datasets is that the GeoDataset does not index the dataset with an integer, but rather with a Bounding Box consisting of *geographical* coordinates. More specifically, every GeoDataset has a dataset.index object which is an R-tree (link here) containing the Bounding Boxes and filenames of all raster or vector files in the dataset. In TorchGeo there exists a custom GeoSampler that takes care of the indexing into geospatial datsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we finally take a closer look at how to set up the data pipeline, it should be mentioned that a majority of TorchGeo's geospatial datasets do not contain both images and labels, as you might expect, but only one of the top. This means that if we are interested in a certain TorchGeo dataset that only contains labels and want to train a model to make predictions from raw satellite imagery, we need to pair this particular dataset with an available imagery dataset of the same resolution. In many cases, TorchGeo can do this automatically. "
